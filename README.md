# Data Science Portfolio
Welcome to Jacob's Data Science Protfolio. Here, you can find a number of completed data science projects that showcase comprehension in various tools, languages, and statistical analyses.

## Project One: Mortgage Optimizer 
The purpose of this code is to determine the optimal time to purchase a home (if any) in order to minimize cumulative pre-retirement expenses toward the cost of housing.

Tool uses a nested for loop to iterate through the time at which a home is purchased.

## Project Two (Machine Learning): Netflix Revenue Regression
This code performs pre-processing and employs sklearn-based regression algorithms (including linear, ridge, random forest, and ridge regressions) to determine the relationship between revenue generated by Netflix subscribers and various demographic factors. 

## Project Three (Machine Learning): Customer Clustering
This code performs pre-processing and employs sklearn-based clustering algorithms (including KMeans, agglomerative, and gaussian mixture clustering) to segment Walmart customers based on their age, annual income, and spending score.

## Project Four (Deep Learning): MNIST Classification
This code performs pre-processing of the MNIST dataset, and employs Keras/Tensorflow to generate a fully connected neural network for the purposes of image classification. 

## Capstone and Dashboarding (Random Data Science and Machine Learning Projects from IBM Course)
